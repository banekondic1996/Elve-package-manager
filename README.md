This is just vibe coded sort of package manager for linux <br>
Why? <br>
Cause i need one for my linux desktop environment I'm making. <br>
It's just simple search and install packages, uninstall, install with exported list. Not much going on here. <br>
Best part is that it works on Arch, Debian, RHEL <br> <br>
